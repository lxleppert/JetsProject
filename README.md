## Technologies Used
- Java 8
- JUnit 4
- Google research
- Eclipse AArch64
- MacOS on Silicon

## Topics
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Looping for user input (for, enhanced for, and while)
- Visibility

## What I Learned
- The various ways abstract classes and interfaces can be implemented 
- Not to get sidetracked with unnecessary details before I have functional code
